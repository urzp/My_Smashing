          <p>What fuels your work? What fuels your mind? What do you do on a
            non-productive day or when you’re sad? Nowadays, I try to embrace
             these times. I try to relax and not be angry at myself for not
             being productive. And the fun fact about it? Well, most of the
             times when I could convince my mind that not being productive is
             nothing to feel bad about, things take a sudden turn: I get my
             ideas back, my productivity rises and, in effect, I even achieve
              more work than on an average day. It’s important to try to be
               human.</p>

          <p>This visual introduction to machine learning explains how computers
            apply statistical learning techniques to automatically identify
            patterns in data. If you’re not familiar with how machine learning
            works, this will give you a rough idea.
            As we’ve seen in statistics and data from the NASA before, this
            is, unfortunately, the truth: 2016 was the hottest year on
            record. The consequences: Nearly a quarter of the Great Barrier
            Reef died, Canada had to deal with the costliest wildfires ever,
            and the Arctic sea ice has been at its smallest winter maximum
            for two years now. And do you remember Hurricane Matthew? Such
            weather events are mostly driven by the climate change that we’re
            facing right now, with no trend of change over the upcoming years.
            Fortunately, there’s something everyone of us can do: The UN shows
            how we can take action, even from the couch at home.
            And with that, I’ll close for this week. If you like what I
            write each week, please support me with a donation or share this
            resource with other people. You can learn more about the costs
            of the project here. It’s available via email, RSS and online.—
